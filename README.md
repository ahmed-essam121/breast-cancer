🚀 Breast Cancer Data Analysis and Prediction Project

I conducted an in-depth analysis of breast cancer data using Power BI, creating visual insights to highlight trends and patterns in tumor characteristics.

To enhance the analysis, I developed two machine learning models:
🔍 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with an accuracy of 77%
🌲 Decision Tree with an accuracy of 92%

These models provided robust predictions for breast cancer classification, demonstrating the power of combining data visualization and machine learning.

This project showcases my experience in data analytics and predictive modeling. I'd love to connect and discuss it further! 😊
